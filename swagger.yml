    ## ðŸ“‹ Overview

    This service dynamically executes a set of remote API requests based on configurations stored in the system. Acting as a smart orchestrator, it applies authentication, request formatting, and execution logic for each API entry â€” and aggregates the responses into a single, structured result.

    Each API call is executed using its designated authentication strategy (API Key, Basic, Bearer, or Basic + Bearer), with secure credential handling via AES encryption. This centralized mechanism enables dynamic data retrieval from multiple external sources without hardcoding any remote API details in client applications.

    Designed for flexibility and scalability, this service simplifies integration with external APIs while ensuring consistent security and error handling across all calls.

    ### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

    - Dynamically fetch and execute remote API requests based on stored configurations
    - Support multiple authentication strategies (API Key, Basic, Bearer, Basic + Bearer)
    - Securely handle encrypted credentials using runtime decryption (AES-256-CBC)
    - Apply per-API query parameters, headers, and body content as configured
    - Aggregate success and failure results in a unified response object
    - Gracefully handle partial failures without impacting unrelated API responses
    - Simplify third-party API integration for client applications through a centralized gateway
